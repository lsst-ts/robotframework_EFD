This Dockerfile and accompanying files are designed to create a Docker image to use for testing LSST software.

It creates an image based on the AlmaLinux base image, and installs Python3.8, Robot-Framework, the SQRE-provided lsst_efd_client package, and other test related dependencies.

The user is saluser and testing should done with that account.
